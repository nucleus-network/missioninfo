              Preparation Instructions and Tips 
            </h2>
            
            <p>
              Select a batch of articles for learners to engage with in the lesson  
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Use a pre-populated batch from the Legit-O-Meter app</li>
              <li>Or create your own batch using the following criteria </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              <i>Article Selection Guidelines</i>
            </p>
            
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Pick a topic</strong> – Try to select an issue that has been covered in a variety of information outlets. An issue that is controversial, or debated, also works well for this exercise.</li>
              <li><strong>Select your articles</strong> – Try to select a range of articles from various information outlets. And remember, you can contact your school or local public library if you need help selecting sources. </li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>
              Use the following criteria to help you get select your own articles for this activity. 
            </p>
            
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Reputable sources</strong> – Use sources like newspapers, magazines, or television outlets that are generally well regarded. </li>
            <ul>
              <li>Tip – Try for a blend of national and local news sources </li>
              <li>Tip – Look for variety in terms of who wrote the article (a professional journalist, a scholar, etc.), publication outlet (a local magazine, a national newspaper), and overall point of view or bias </li>
              <li>To find reputable sources aimed at teens, try the <a href="https://www.tweentribune.com/">Smithsonian Tween Tribune</a>, <a href="http://www.teenvogue.com/">Teen Vogue</a>, or <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/extra">PBS NewsHour Extra</a>. </li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Fake News sources</strong> – Use sources that publish false and/or misleading information  </li>
            <ul>
              <li>Tip- Use resources like <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2016/01/14/fake-news-sites/">Snopes</a> and <a href="http://www.politifact.com/">PolitiFact</a> to find fake news sites. If you plan to use a site like PolitiFact with learners, take a few minutes to demonstrate how the site is organized.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Opinion sources </strong>– Use sources like editorials, personal essays, or personal blogs. Op-eds from reputable outlets work well here. </li>
            <li><strong>Sponsored content sources</strong> – Content with built-in advertising or something that is trying to sell you something  </li>
            <li><strong>Satirical sources</strong> – Try finding your topic on the Onion  </li>
            <li><strong>Media sources</strong> - Consider including video or audio news stories from sources like the BBC, NPR, or PBS NewsHour </li>
            </ol>
            
             <h2>
              Facilitation Tips 
            </h2>
            
            <ul>
              <li>This lesson includes a main activity and an additional, optional activity. The optional activity is more advanced and can work as an activity for a separate follow-up class, as an activity extension for a longer class period (such as a 90 minute class period), or as an additional activity if learners complete the first activity quickly. </li>
              <li>This lesson can work well as a group activity that can encourage collaboration, discussion, and teamwork. </li>
              <li>Think carefully about your theme and the selected articles. </li>
              <li>Try completing the Legit-O-Meter worksheets on your own first. </li>
              <li>Facilitation suggestion - assign groups one fake news example and one more reputable example so they can contrast the two. </li>
              <li>Instructors can customize this activity by determining how many articles each group is assigned, or by having learners complete this activity individually rather than in groups depending on class size. </li>
              <li>Instructors can also customize this activity to best fit the reading and writing level of their learners, such as by selecting a smaller number of shorter articles. </li>
              <li>Encourage learners to read aloud to one another as they work through their assigned article or articles. </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>
              Vocabulary
            </h2>
            
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Bias</strong>- To be in favor of or against one person, thing, idea, etc. </li>
              <li><strong>Credibility</strong>- The quality of being trusted or believed in.</li>
              <li><strong>Fake News</strong>- A term generally used to indicate information that is false. </li>
              <li><strong>Misinformation</strong>-  A broader term that includes fake news. Misinformation includes information that is false or otherwise misleading, both deliberately and unintentionally. Examples of misinformation can include fake websites that mimic real ones, misleading headlines, satire, false statements, etc.</li>
              <li><strong> Anonymous source</strong>- The identity of the source is kept hidden or secret. </li>
            </ul>
