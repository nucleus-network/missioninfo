# Mission: Information Curriculum 
## :wave: :tada: Hello and welcome! :tada: :wave: 
### :mag: What is Mission:Information? :mag: 
<p>Mozilla's Mission:Information Curriculum is an open-source and interactive set of three lessons that help teens develop news and web literacy skills, and have some fun while doing so. This curriculum was created as a way to help teens deal with fake news and misinformation that they might encounter online. A main goal of this curriculum is to empower learners to become strong consumers, producers, and distributors of news and media.</p> 
### Who created Mission:Information?
<p>This curriculum was developed by Nucleus Learning Network, Open Austin, and The Austin Monitor in partnership with Mozilla.</p>
