# Mission: Information Curriculum 
## :wave: :tada: Hello and welcome! :tada: :wave: 

### :mag: What is Mission:Information? :mag:
<p>Mission:Information is an open-source and interactive curriculum that helps teens develop media and web literacy skills, and have some fun while doing so. This curriculum was created as a way to help teens deal with fake news and misinformation that they might encounter online. A main goal of this curriculum is to empower learners to become strong consumers, producers, and distributors of news and media.</p> 

### Who created Mission:Information?
<p>This curriculum was developed by Nucleus Learning Network, Open Austin, and The Austin Monitor in partnership with Mozilla. This project follows <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/">Mozilla's Community Participation Guidelines</a>. Visit the link to learn more!</p>

### What work is being done currently and how can I get involved? 
<p>Sarah Morris from Nucleus Learning Network is currently a Mozilla Open Leaders Fellow and is working on a new computer science lesson to supplement the original three Mission:Information Lessons. This new lesson will help learners gain a new perspective on misinformation and fake news by focusing on algorithms, and will help learners continue to strengthen their media and web literacy skills. </p>
<p>Here are some ways that you can get involved!</p>
<ul>
  <li>Provide feedback and ideas here on GitHub or via this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13vd5r2vM5gJkISBDT-MH4eRRW7Qic5JO1brYQjYr5Us/edit?usp=sharing">Google Doc</a>. Weâ€™d love to hear from educators, particularly those who work with teens, people with computer science experience, and media professionals. All educators are welcome, whether you work in a library, a museum, a nonprofit, a school, a higher education environment, etc.   </li>
  <li> Build apps and tools. If you have technology skills and are inspired by this lesson, feel free to go wild developing associated apps and tools. </li>
