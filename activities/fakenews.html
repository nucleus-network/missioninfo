            </h2>
            <p>
              In our last lesson, Legit-O-Meter, learners developed skills to critically evaluate news sources and to spot misinformation. In this lesson, learners can further hone their critical evaluation skills by exploring the strategies used to create misinformation and by deconstructing misinformation. </p>

            <p>
              The following are some additional activities to help your learners further develop their evaluation skills to deal with fake news.</p>

       <p>
                Print out the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8-SimdzdCfCc2VZNU50SVNwaG8/view?usp=sharing">Emoji flashcards</a> for your learners. You can use either the online or print versions of the worksheets depending on your needs. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Select an article, or a batch of articles, for learners to engage with and remix in the lesson  
            </p>

           <ul>
              <li>Use a pre-populated batch from the Legit-O-Meter lesson. See the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10DFE8AbHXQCGmtRi73eJbX06okjH-NcM4hs3LLYjsNY/edit?usp=sharing">Legit-O-Meter article batches</a> for ideas.</li>
              <li>Or create your own batch. See the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AXQYeGovawxxRChDmLyIfT5VuUa67mJhPQNVDX0FHjo/edit?usp=sharing">Legit-O-Meter article selection template</a> for ideas.</li>

              <i>Article Selection Guidelines</i>
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Pick a topic</strong> – Select a topic that is debated, though also appropriate for your learning community. You can also try to pick a topic that has already generated fake news coverage, such as stories about climate change or sports scandals. You can use topics and articles from the Legit-O-Meter activity here, or select a new topic to use. </li>
              <li><strong>Select your articles</strong> – Select articles that are reputable and credible for your learners to remix into misinformation. And remember, you can contact your school or local public library if you need help selecting sources. </li>
              <li><strong>Tip</strong> - For this activity you can assign groups of learners the same article to remix or give each group different articles from a common theme, such as a sports controversy</li>
              <li><strong>Tip</strong> - Consider going local with this activty and have your learners engage with articles that report on things in the local community. Misinformation often targets issues that people care about, and local issues can have the potential to inspire an emotional reaction. Check with your school or a local librarian for help selecting local news articles!</li>
            </ul>
           
             <h2>
              Facilitation Tips 
            </h2>
         <ul>
              <li>This lesson includes a main activity and an additional, optional activity. The optional activity is more advanced and can work as an activity for a separate follow-up class or as an activity extension for a longer class period (such as a 90 minute class period)</li>
              <li>This lesson can work well as a group activity that can encourage collaboration, discussion, and teamwork. </li>
              <li>Test out X-Ray Goggles to familiarize yourself with the tool. You can use <a href="https://goggles.mozilla.org/">X-Ray Goggles</a> for the online version of this activity. If you are in a situation without the needed technology, you can run this activity offline with paper versions of the worksheets. </li>
              <li>Try completing the Fake Your Own News worksheets on your own first </li>
              <li>Instructors can customize this activity by determining how to divide learners into groups and how many articles or topics to use for the Fake Your Own News activity</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>
              Vocabulary
            </h2>
              <ul>
              <li>Bias - From Legit-O-Meter, we learned that bias means to be in favor of or against an idea, issue, etc. Bias can sometimes make a person more or less likely to believe information. </li>
              <li>Demographic group - A segment of a population with shared characteristics, such as age or income </li>
            </ul>
