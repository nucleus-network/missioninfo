            <p>This lesson encourages learners to develop and use their skim reading skills. Sam Wineburg, a Stanford professor, highlights the idea of reading "horizontally," or looking at an article's context while deploying skim reading skills.

            <h2>
              Preparation Instructions and Tips 
            </h2>
            
            <p>
              Select a topic and a batch of articles for learners to engage with in the lesson  
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Use a pre-populated batch from the Legit-O-Meter article batches guide</li>
              <li>Or create your own batch using the following criteria </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              <i>Article Selection Guidelines</i>
            </p>
            
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Pick a topic</strong> – Try to select an issue that has been covered in a variety of information outlets. An issue that is debated, can work well for this exercise. Depending on your needs and situation, you can also use more humorous or neutral topics to run the lesson for the first time, and then introduce more complex or controversial topics as your learners progress.</li>
              <li><strong>Select your articles</strong> – Try to select a range of articles from various information outlets. And remember, you can contact your school or local public library if you need help selecting sources. </li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>
              Use the following criteria to help you get select your own blend of articles for this activity. 
            </p>
            
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Reputable sources</strong> – Use sources like newspapers, magazines, or television outlets that are generally well regarded. </li>
            <ul>
              <li>Tip – Try for a blend of national and local news sources </li>
              <li>Tip – Look for variety in terms of who wrote the article (a professional journalist, a scholar, etc.), publication outlet (a local magazine, a national newspaper), and overall point of view or bias </li>
              <li>To find reputable sources aimed at teens, try the <a href="https://www.tweentribune.com/">Smithsonian Tween Tribune</a>, <a href="http://www.teenvogue.com/">Teen Vogue</a>, or <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/extra">PBS NewsHour Extra</a>. </li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Fake News sources</strong> – Use sources that publish false and/or misleading information  </li>
            <ul>
              <li>Tip- Use resources like <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2016/01/14/fake-news-sites/">Snopes</a> and <a href="http://www.politifact.com/">PolitiFact</a> to find fake news sites and stories. If you plan to use a site like PolitiFact with learners, take a few minutes to demonstrate how the site is organized.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Opinion sources </strong>– Use sources like editorials, personal essays, or personal blogs. Op-eds from reputable outlets work well here. </li>
            <li><strong>Satirical sources</strong> – Try finding your topic on the Onion  </li>
            <li><strong>Media sources</strong> - Consider including video or audio news stories from sources like the BBC, NPR, or PBS NewsHour </li>
            </ol>

              Facilitation Tips: Preparing the Activity  
            </h2>
            
            <ul>
              <li>This lesson includes a main activity and an additional, optional activity. The optional activity is more advanced and can work as an activity for a separate follow-up class, as an activity extension for a longer class period (such as a 90 minute class period), or as an additional activity if learners complete the first activity quickly. </li>
              <li>This lesson can be repeated with different topics, different types of articles, and different degrees of complexity. You can conduct this lesson with a more humorous or neutral topics and then repeat the lesson with more complex topics and types of articles as your learners progress in their skills.</li>
              <li>Think carefully about your theme and the selected articles. </li>
              <li>Try completing the Legit-O-Meter worksheets on your own first. </li>
              <li>Instructors can customize this activity by determining how many articles each group is assigned, or by having learners complete this activity individually rather than in groups depending on class size. </li>
              <li>Facilitation tip: have all your learners read the same article to start. You can then repeat the activity and have different groups read different types of articles and share and compare their findings. </li>
              <li>Instructors can also customize this activity to best fit the reading and writing level of their learners, such as by selecting a smaller number of shorter articles. </li>
          
            </ul>
            
           <h2>
             Facilitation Tips: Running the Activity 
            </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Facilitation suggestion - assign groups one fake news example and one more reputable example so they can contrast the two. </li>
                  <li>Encourage learners to read aloud to one another as they work through their assigned article or articles. </li>
               <li>Encourage learners to use their skim reading skills. </li>
                <li>This lesson can work well as a group activity that can encourage collaboration, discussion, and teamwork. </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>
              Vocabulary
            </h2>

              <li><strong>Misinformation</strong>-  A broader term that includes fake news.

              <li>Have learners divide into small groups (3-4 learners)  </li>
              <li>Prompt: What does “credible” mean? How do you decide if information is credible? What things do you look for?  </li>
              <li>Have learners write their thoughts down on paper, or up on a class whiteboard</li>

                <li>Make sure your learners understand vocabulary such as bias and credibility</li>
                <li>Points to highlight - Bias isn’t inherently good or bad, but it is important to recognize it when you see it</li>
                <li>Fake news comes in many forms and misinformation is a broader way of talking about information that might not be credible or true</li>
