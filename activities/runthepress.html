      <h2>
              Learning Progression 
            </h2>
            
            <p>
              In this lesson, learners will:
            </p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>Explore the long history of fake news and misinformation</li>
              <li>Map out a fake news story to explore how it spreads</li>
              <li>Work through scenarios where they can make decisions about what news to share, and experience the consequences of those decisions </li>
              <li>Reflect on their learning</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>
              Scaffolding and Resources 
            </h2>
            
            <p>
              In the Legit-O-Meter lesson, learners developed evaluation skills and strategies to identify fake news and misinformation. In Fake Your Own News, learners deconstructed the components of fake news and explored how fake news is created, and how it can be effective. </p>

             <p> In Run the Presses, learners will synthesize their knowledge and skills from the previous lessons as they take on the role of an editor who must decide what news to publish, and how to publish it. Learners will be able to exercise skills and competencies including evaluation and critical thinking skills, communication strategies, and an understanding of the characteristics of fake news and misinformation.  Learners will also consider how they act as editors in their daily life and how they can better share credible content on social media. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
              The following is an additional activity to help your learners further develop their web and news literacy skills:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>The <a href="http://www.fakeittomakeitgame.com/ ">Fake it to Make It Game</a> is a way to help learners further explore the consequences and motivations (such as money) that drive fake news</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>Print out the scenario cards and worksheet if you are playing an offline version of the game </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>
              Facilitation Tips 
            </h2>
            
            <ul>
              <li>This lesson can work well as a group activity that can encourage collaboration, discussion, and teamwork. </li>
              <li>Try completing the Run the Presses worksheets on your own first.</li>
              <li>Instructors can customize this activity by determining how to divide learners into groups and how many topic scenarios to use for the Run the Presses activity. </li>
            </ul>

              <li>Brief discussion - Fake news and misinformation aren’t new. In fact, news stories have gotten out of control for quite a long time. </li>
              <li>Share 1-2 historical fake news examples with your learners and walk through the sequence of events and consequences together </li>
              <li>Use the following prompts to guide discussion </li>

You can also open this up to let learners use a current or historic example they already know about. </li>
               <li>Facilitation tip: You can have learners come to class with a chosen fake news story that they can use for this activity </li>
             </ul>
             <li>Learners will draw a map of their chosen fake news story, including the origin point, how the story spread, how people countered the fake news story with things like fact checking, and the consequences of the story. </li>
             <ul>
               <li>Facilitation tip: Encourage learners to be creative with how they draw their maps and represent their chosen fake news story </li>
